  <h1>🌟 The Journey of Patience</h1>
 <p>

The journey of patience may be long, <br>
But light is found exactly there,<br>
Where the heart quietly learns<br>
To trust and to endure.<br>
<br>
Storms may roar and winds may break,<br>
Times may seem unbearably hard—<br>
Yet the gentle hand of patience<br>
Strengthens the soul within.<br>
<br>
What is hard today<br>
May turn easy tomorrow;<br>
The tiny seeds of patience<br>
Bloom into flowers in their own time.<br>
<br>
So do not stop, do not fall,<br>
Fear not the darkness around—<br>
What is meant for you<br>
Will arrive at your door<br>
When the time is right.</p>
